                <hr class="pain">

                <p class="hisp">Leiden was made on an artificial hill (now the Burcht van Leiden) where the rivers Oude and Nieuwe Rijn meet. In the oldest mention of this, in 860, the settlement was called Leithon. Leiden grew quickly in the 16th and 17th century. At
                    the end of the 15th century the weaving companies of Leiden were very important, and Leiden developed an important printing and publishing industry.</p>

                <p class="hisp">In 1572, the city sided with the Dutch revolt against Spanish and played an important role in the Eighty Years' War. Sieged from May until October 1574, Leiden was helped by cutting off the dikes, letting ships to carry provisions to the
                    people of the flooded town. As a reward the University of Leiden was founded by William I of Orange in 1575. The siege ended on October 3rd, people still celebrate it to this day.</p>

                <p class="hisp1">The 3rd of October typically takes place over the course of two to three days (three only if there's a Sunday on the same weekend) and includes parades, a hutspot feast, and a funfair.The city has recently started to host the Leiden International
                    Film Festival, the fastest growing festival of its type in the Netherlands.</p>
